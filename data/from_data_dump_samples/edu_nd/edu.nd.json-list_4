The Relationship between Student Debt and Lifecycle Transitions", "description": "This paper uses the Survey of Consumer Finances and an estimation strategy developed by Gicheva (2012) to estimate the relationships between student loans and lifecycle transitions. I use probit models and an instrumental variables strategy to address concerns about endogenous student loan amounts. First, I replicate the primary results of Gicheva (2012) using an updated data set, and find that student loans decrease the probability that both men and women have ever been married. Then, I show that student debt is correlated with a lower probability of having had a child by a particular age for both men and women. When an instrument is used, however, this relationship does not hold; in fact, student loans increase fertility at younger ages. I discuss possible channels for this effect.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:24Z"}, {"@id": "_:d49188849c9078776109c1ee026a088b", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/9s161544m9s", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:309015a163a9449a57e84fa8fa49f782", "@type": "Publication"}}]}

For navigation and mapping, the robot has only one sensor, which tracks the directions of depth discontinuities. There are no coordinates, and the robot is given a motion primitive that allows it to move toward discontinuities. The robot is incapable of performing localization or measuring any distances or angles. Nevertheless, when dropped into an unknown planar environment, the robot builds a data structure, called the Gap Navigation Tree, which enables it to navigate optimally in terms of Euclidean distance traveled. In a sense, the robot is able to learn the critical information contained in the classical shortest-path roadmap, although surprisingly it is unable to extract metric information. We prove these results for the case of a point robot placed into a simply connected, piecewise-analytic planar environment. The case of multiply connected environments is also addressed, in which it is shown that further sensing assumptions are needed. Due to the limited sensor given to the robot, globally optimal navigation is impossible; however, our approach achieves locally optimal (within a homotopy class) navigation, which is the best that is theoretically possible under this robot model", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:25Z"}, {"@id": "_:350047930d4c7fd6a5c96df9227f3cbc", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/ks65h99093x", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:920e07e6259f80d8a2148b62eb775e19", "@type": "Article"}}]}

Survey results were summarized in a 2010 report that documented standard practice, moderate-use, and low-use book conservation treatments for special collections and general collections in research libraries in the United States. Similarities and differences between special and general collections practices were highlighted. In an effort to better understand the differences in practices observed in the first report, the authors revisit the data to identify whether, and how, the demographic characteristics of book conservation practitioners are correlated with particular treatment practices. Noting the trend suggested in the literature toward both hybrid facilities--those dedicated to both special and general collections--as well as hybrid practitioners, the authors were especially curious whether such facilitates and practitioners might approach treatment differently. The data collected in 2007 were analyzed to identify whether key demographic variables--such as practitioner training, type of collections served by a practitioner, size of library, type of library, and type of conservation facility--were correlated with specific treatment practices. In this report, specific trends associated with the demographic variables are identified and explored. Areas of further research suggested by the results of the study are identified.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:28Z"}, {"@id": "_:5a06433b9c58fafaf38aae7916b620eb", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/ks65h991w4t", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:2a1ff0dabf89216a37222921e986d76b", "@type": "Article"}}]}

Despite such dramatic growth and definition within the field, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the book treatment practices employed by research libraries for special and general collections. In response to this need, a study was undertaken to investigate and document the types of treatments employed by research libraries to conserve and maintain their book collections, and to compare the practices used for special collections with those used for general collections. This paper describes the evolution of the field over the past fifty years and identifies book conservation techniques the study found to be routinely, moderately, or rarely employed in research libraries. A comparison of special and general collections treatment practices suggests that while notable differences exist, many treatment practices are common in both contexts.

This is a state by state content analysis of all fifty states to look at the topics, types, formats, quality, and interactivity of the available resources. By merging two information frameworks, one with theoretical attention to components of access to information and one with applied attention to government information valuation measures, the research demonstrates an analysis process that connects state cattle producer demographics for comparison with aspects of the available cattle identification and traceability information from that state.

I will also address two ways of data ingest, issues surrounding each, and future needs for the system. In coming to understand these changes, I will address methods that we used to compare our repository with others both institutional and otherwise, and how our partnership with a separate open access data repository benefits researcher needs beyond the system.

It argues that complex projectile weapons of the kind used by ethnographic hunter-gatherers, such as the bow and arrow, and spearthrower and dart, enabled Homo sapiens to overcome obstacles that constrained previous human dispersal from Africa to temperate western Eurasia. In the East Mediterranean Levant, the only permanent land bridge between Africa and Eurasia, stone and bone projectile armatures like those used in the complex weapon systems of recent humans appear abruptly ca 45–35 Ka in early Upper Paleolithic contexts associated with Homo sapiens fossils. Such artifacts are absent from Middle Paleolithic contexts associated with Homo sapiens and Neandertals. Hypotheses concerning the indigenous vs. exogenous origins of complex projectile weaponry in the Levant are reviewed. Current evidence favors the hypothesis that complex projectile technology developed as an aid to ecological niche broadening strategies among African populations between 50–100 Ka. It most likely spread to western Eurasia along with dispersing Homo sapiens populations. Neandertals did not routinely deploy projectile weapons as subsistence aids. This puzzling gap in their otherwise impressive record for survival in some of the harshest environments ever occupied by primates may reflect energetic constraints and time-budgeting factors associated with complex technology.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:32Z"}, {"@id": "_:fcde80d5562fffd3d8050a77c71fb973", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/ks65h991p9p", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:07e1e6a3fea56704254a847fa2ee6644", "@type": "Article"}}]}

Here we use this in combination with an alternate measure, the Tip Cross-Sectional Perimeter, a more accurate proxy of the force needed to penetrate a target to a lethal depth. The current study discusses this measure and uses it to analyze a collection of measurements from African Middle Stone Age pointed stone artifacts.

Managing research outputs becomes a tall order of many universities, given their determined agenda to pursue research excellence. In a world of increasingly data-intensive research, data are rising as a critical component of scholarly communication, often mandated by granting agencies. Data curation, preservation, and access are paramount to the university academic mission, and academic and research libraries are some of the few entities of the universities that carry out such functions; however, libraries’ enduring commitments in print and current operations, and complex campus organizations, often hinder their ability to quickly respond to the data needs of the academy. Notre Dame’s investment in research was recently reinforced by the University’s approval of the expansion of 10 disciplines, such as computational data, adult stem cell research, and nuclear physics. There is a great need for support for research data on campus. The Hesburgh Libraries has been building an institutional digital repository since winter 2012. To respond to the emerging trends, in June 2013 the Libraries switched to a user-centered, agile approach to develop data curation and access services. The goal remains to accept all scholarly outputs (text, images, video and audio), but with an imminent emphasis on research support, and the strategy is to grow, simultaneously, data curation services and the user base, and to build success stories to drive adoptions along the way. Early adopters were identified with the help of subject librarians, and they determined the most critical baseline features for the Libraries to develop. Hydra open source solutions were also leveraged, and Notre Dame collaborated with Northwestern University, Indiana University, and the University of Virginia to create a new community shared Institutional Repository (IR) system. Early adopters have been piloting features since summer 2013, and a full rollout is planned by November 2014. This session will include the project’s development philosophy to overcome resource shortages to meet high demands on research support, the strategy to reach and develop a user base and roadmap, insights on faculty’s needs for research support, the methodology to leverage and contribute to open source tools, and a quick demo of the curation tool.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:32Z"}, {"@id": "_:96b6a84053da1d8a7c2b57c1dda8f97d", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/ks65h991t3v", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:018607b865d949005ec771aaf8619a4b", "@type": "Presentation"}}]}

Hunter-gatherer populations are not restricted by extensive ownership and often focus settlement on important resources. Analysis of settlement patterns left by these groups reveals key information about subsistence and sociality. Patterning among modern groups is extremely varied and represents a dynamic and adaptable land-use strategy. The antiquity of this adaptability is unknown, but comparisons with the patterns left by other hominin species often show it as a derived trait of Homo sapiens. However, most of these settlement models are built at a species level resolution and encompass great chronological and environmental variation. Also, the dense record of recent Homo sapiens populations makes the chance of recognizing settlement variability higher than for preceding hominin species. This project addressed these issues by testing aspects of species-level models for late Middle Paleolithic (Neanderthal) and early Upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens) sites in the Middle Vézère Valley (Dordogne, France). This region has the advantages of diverse environmental characters and a well-understood archaeological chronology representing several subdivisions of these broad periods. Using tools from Geographic Information Systems, taphonomic biases in the sample were investigated and site locations correlated with relevant landscape characters. The patterns revealed both support and contradict aspects of species-level  settlement models. Upper Paleolithic sites are found significantly closer to the river and at low elevation sheltered locations. They are more likely to be near natural fords in the river and have a good view of these areas. Middle Paleolithic sites, in contrast, are found in variable locations but more often on the higher elevation plateau and within a short distance from multiple biomes.  The final distillation of these correlations reveals a pattern of Middle Paleolithic focus on heterogeneous environments where diverse resources would be available. Upper Paleolithic settlement is instead focused a specific environment, possibly indicating intense exploitation of a single resource. In this region, this appears to be places where migrating herd animals would be at a disadvantage, like river crossings and narrow valleys. In this small region there is a clear settlement difference between Middle and Upper Paleolithic populations, but more focused studies must be undertaken before these results can be broadly extended.

What follows is an example of such hybrid, computationally assisted scholarship. It begins with a question: How can we define and assess the “geographic imagination” of American fiction around the Civil War, and how did the geographic investments of American literature change across that sociopolitical event? It is, at first order, an intervention in existing debates about space, regionalism, and the dynamics of large-scale cultural change. To preview quickly the most important direct results, we find that there is significant national and international dispersion of geographic reference in American novels written between 1851 and 1875; that the distribution of place references tracks closely but not perfectly with population; that changes in literary investment in specific places and regions tends to lag changes in population; and that although there are important shifts in the geographic distribution of literary interest occasioned by the Civil War, such shifts are smaller than established theories would lead us to expect.  Beyond presenting this new, broad-based information about the distribution of literary-geographic attention in the mid-nineteenth century, my specific claims are three: First, that the New England-centered understanding of American literature and culture that grows out of foundational studies such as F. O. Matthiessen’s American Renaissance and Sacvan Bercovitch’s The Puritan Origins of the American Self is misleading and ultimately unsustainable when applied to the full literary field of the midcentury. Second, that literary regionalism, as measured by any large uptick in the actual use of regionally dispersed locations, does not arise in the decade following the Civil War, though certain of its roots can be traced at least as far back as 1850. In both cases, our view of the era’s literary production should be revised to reflect its significant investment in urban and international locations, as well as the wide range of those locales. Third, that we must rethink significantly our theory of periodizing events in light of the striking continuity of literary-geographic usage across the outbreak and conclusion of the Civil War. This last point isn’t an attack on periodization as such, but we do need, I think, to pay much closer attention to the substantive continuities that underlie our narratives of historical evolution, even when those narratives are built around such seemingly obvious breaks as the event of national insurrection.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:33Z"}, {"@id": "_:3b6bc007cf5dfdc8d588c274506d40aa", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/n296ww74m3t", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:c94c731117c656bef7c64d0dbe0426ed", "@type": "Article"}}]}

Both isolation and preservation of artifacts can be challenging due to the complexity of existing software and systems and the resulting implicit dependencies, resource distribution, and shifting compatibility of systems as time progresses---all conspiring to break the reproducibility of an application. Sandboxing is a technique that has been used extensively in OS environments for isolation of computational artifacts. Several tools were proposed recently that employ sandboxing as a mechanism to ensure reproducibility. However, none of these tools preserve the sandboxed application for re-distribution to a larger scientific community---aspects that are equally crucial for ensuring reproducibility as sandboxing itself. In this paper, we describe a combined sandboxing and preservation framework, which is efficient, invariant and practical for large-scale reproducibility. We present case studies of complex high energy physics applications and show how the framework can be useful for sandboxing, preserving and distributing applications. We report on the completeness, performance, and efficiency of the framework, and suggest possible standardization approaches.

There are viable solutions for expanding the role of the librarian in ways that could lead to better faculty partnerships. First, librarians must be grounded in a shared purpose and professional identity and establish a contextual framework for our own professional ‘boundaries.’ We cannot create an intersection with the knowledge and experience of others if we do not have an understanding of our own frame. Interviews and investigation of the professional literature led to a re-discovery of communities of practice. Communities of practice (CoPs) are promising tools for librarians because they can be used to develop and sustain professional identity. Once the shared purpose and practice is identified, CoPs can facilitate collaboration between librarians and faculty and develop partnerships that will increase understanding, create meaningful connections and improve perception. Communities of practice build professional empathy, and this empathetic understanding is the essence of alignment. Once our services are aligned with the needs and expectations of our users, we will become more relevant and valuable to our institutions.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:35Z"}, {"@id": "_:e4224ba22184a2e177c02ab7d310bbb0", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/6682x34898q", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:ecad96790cc89ae6b83285787a27467b", "@type": "Article"}}]}

The aim of these revisions is to increase rates of early diagnosis of HIV via the routinization of HIV testing. Despite the publication and promotion of the CDC’s revisions, and the existence of simple and safe Food and Drug Administration-approved (FDA) test kits, many fields of health care practice - including dentistry - have been slow to adopt them.  OBJECTIVE The purpose of this survey was to describe knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of potential barriers/facilitators related to conducting rapid oral HIV testing at an urban dental school among the school’s students, faculty, and staff.  METHODS An anonymous, online survey was sent via list-serv to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Dentistry (COD) college-wide list-serv (n=957).   RESULTS Of the 102 surveys initiated (10.6% response rate), 83 were submitted (81% completion rate). Of the 83 respondents (54% male, 46% female), 43% reported their role at the UIC COD to be faculty, 43% indicated they were dental students (75% were DMD students, 25% were DMD Advanced Standing students). A majority of respondents (75%) “have ever provided dental care for HIV+ individuals,” 52% “have ever taken a workshop or similar educational offering related to HIV/AIDS,” and 27% “have ever participated in volunteer work with HIV+ individuals.”   Knowledge. The mean score on the knowledge component of the questionnaire was 8.37 (10 points possible) (SD 0.96). Broad knowledge of the CDC’s 2006 revised recommendations was lacking, with only 4% of respondents selecting the correct response to this question.  Attitudes. A majority of respondents did not endorse prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes (at least 69% on the 4 items). Responses to items related to stereotyping were divided: while a majority of respondents endorsed 4 items consistent with beliefs that HIV+ individuals bear responsibility for their status (62%), having knowingly (70%) engaged in risky behavior (80%) and are more at fault for their status than HIV+ individuals who acquired the virus via blood transfusion (59%), a minority of respondents (10%) thought that “HIV+ patients do not share the same values” as them, and less than half of respondents (40%) believed that “HIV+ patients tend to have numerous sexual partners.”  Perceptions of barriers/facilitators. A majority of respondents endorsed statements reflecting positive perceptions of rapid oral HIV testing as a practice “contributing to the public good” (93%), a practice on the “cutting edge” (73%), a practice that can enable “dentistry to integrate with other health professions” (92%), and “within the scope of practice of the oral health processions” (82%).  However, a majority of respondents (at least 67% on all 9 items) indicated that each barrier listed would present a challenge to conducting rapid oral HIV testing in a UIC COD clinic at least “sometimes.” Cost (59%), “space for confidential communication” (50%), “clinician discomfort communicating results to patients” (51%), and “patient reactions to results” (50%) were endorsed as “often” or “always” presenting challenges by at least 50% of respondents.  CONCLUSIONS Efforts should be made to improve dissemination of the CDC’s 2006 revisions to their HIV screening recommendations - they are a significant policy document, providing rationale and guidelines for universal HIV screening, as well as outlining an expansion of the roles of health care sites in screening activities - revealing the nascent potential for oral health care fields to play an important role in early HIV detection via screening.  More research is needed to understand factors influencing respondent perceptions of barriers related to conducting rapid oral HIV testing. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews may offer additional insight into perceptions of barriers, as well as provide an opportunity for discussion and exploration of potential approaches to addressing the challenges associated with implementing a pilot rapid oral HIV testing program in a UIC COD clinic.

Therefore, a simple and robust mitotic-chromosome-based approach for the genome mapping of Cx. quinquefasciatus still needs to be developed. In this study, we performed physical mapping of 37 genomic supercontigs using fluorescent in situ hybridization on mitotic chromosomes from imaginal discs of 4th instar larvae. The genetic linkage map nomenclature was adopted for the chromosome numbering based on the direct positioning of 58 markers that were previously genetically mapped. The smallest, largest, and intermediate chromosomes were numbered as 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For idiogram development, we analyzed and described in detail the morphology and proportions of the mitotic chromosomes. Chromosomes were subdivided into 19 divisions and 72 bands of four different intensities. These idiograms were used for mapping the genomic supercontigs/genetic markers. We also determined the presence of length polymorphism in the q arm of sex-determining chromosome 1 in Cx. quinquefasciatus related to the size of ribosomal locus. Our physical mapping and previous genetic linkage mapping resulted in the chromosomal assignment of 13% of the total genome assembly to the chromosome bands.

To address that question, we conducted whole genome microarray based gene expression studies between susceptible and refractory strains of A. aegypti to identify gene expression patterns following challenge with dengue virus. Our analysis of the early infection periods reveals that a large number of genes are involved in a highly coordinated manner either to host or defend against the virus. Genes responding to dengue infection were clustered in seven expression modules. Genes associated with susceptibility to infection were largely clustered in one expression module, while those associated with refractoriness were distributed in four distinct modules. A common core set of genes expressed in both susceptible and refractory individuals were clustered in two expression modules.

The cross section presents several strong resonance contributions, especially for the ground-state transition. Some of the properties of the corresponding levels in the 15O compound nucleus remain uncertain, which affects the uncertainty in extrapolating the capture cross section to the low energy range of astrophysical interest. Purpose: The 14N(p,γ ) 15O cross section can be described by using the phenomenological R matrix. Over the energy range of interest, only the proton and γ -ray channels are open. Since resonance capture makes significant contributions to the 14N(p,γ ) 15O cross section, resonant proton scattering data can be used to provide additional constraints on the R-matrix fit of the capture data. Methods: A 4 MV KN Van de Graaff accelerator was used to bombard protons onto a windowless gas target containing enriched 14N gas over the proton energy range from Ep = 1.0 to 3.0 MeV. Scattered protons were detected at θlab = 90, 120◦, 135◦, 150◦, and 160◦ using ruggedized silicon detectors. In addition, a 10 MV FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator was used to accelerate protons onto a solid Adenine (C5H5N5) target, of natural isotopic abundance, evaporated onto a thin self-supporting carbon backing, over the energy range from Ep = 1.8 to 4.0 MeV. Scattered protons were detected at 28 angles between θlab = 30.4◦ and 167.7◦ by using silicon photodiode detectors. Results: Relative cross sections were extracted from both measurements. While the relative cross sections do not provide as much constraint as absolute measurements, they greatly reduce the dependence of the data on otherwise significant systematic uncertainties, which are more difficult to quantify. The data are fit simultaneously using an R-matrix analysis and level energies and proton widths are extracted. Even with relative measurements, the statistics and large angular coverage of the measurements result in more confident values for the energies and proton widths of several levels; in particular, the broad resonance at Ec.m. = 2.21 MeV, which corresponds to the 3/2+ level at Ex = 9.51 MeV in 15O. In particular, the s- and d-wave angular-momentum channels are separated. Conclusion: The relative cross sections provide a consistent set of data that can be used to better constrain a full multichannel R-matrix extrapolation of the capture data. It has been demonstrated how the scattering data reduce the uncertainty through a preliminary Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis, but several other issues remain that make large contributions to the uncertainty, which must be addressed by further capture and lifetime measurements.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:18:37Z"}, {"@id": "_:adfe31240a9c298311e6aa224fe57899", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/d791sf28f0b", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:6409db7cff0c4a36751df285bf0dc748", "@type": "Article"}}]}

In the United States, surety bonds are usually required while, in Europe, demand guarantees or standby letters of credit are used. This thesis discusses what these types of guarantees are and how guarantee systems operate around the world in order to enhance understanding of guarantees. Following Introduction in Chapter One, Chapter Two articulates guarantee’s history, showing that guarantees have a long history and have been deeply intertwined with human’s transactions. In addition, to understand guarantees mentioned above, their similarities and differences are discussed. Chapter Three deals with relationships between the URDG and other rules, which leads to understanding of backgrounds on why the URDG was first drafted and how those rules affect one another. Chapter Four points out how surety bonds and demand guarantees operate around the world.

The authors also maintain a complementary web page where readers can find supplementary materials and Bertini input files.  * Numerically Solving Polynomial Systems with Bertini* approaches numerical algebraic geometry from a user's point of view with numerous examples of how Bertini is applicable to polynomial systems. It treats the fundamental task of solving a given polynomial system and describes the latest advances in the field, including algorithms for intersecting and projecting algebraic sets, methods for treating singular sets, the nascent field of real numerical algebraic geometry, and applications to large polynomial systems arising from differential equations.  Those who wish to solve polynomial systems can start gently by finding isolated solutions to small systems, advance rapidly to using algorithms for finding positive-dimensional solution sets (curves, surfaces, etc.), and learn how to use parallel computers on large problems.

I argue that the erosion of ties between skilled workers and the living wage occurred in several stages between 1900 and 1930. Having traditionally avoided quantifying the “living wage,” unions were forced to do so within arbitration hearings, especially as these proliferated during and after the First World War. Finding their proposed standards rejected by most boards, union officials turned to an alternative justification for boosting the wages of skilled workers: the need to balance productive capacity with an expanded mass consumer market. That justification would later become a central part of left-wing political economy during the New Deal, while the living wage became tied primarily to efforts to boost minimum rates.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:06Z"}, {"@id": "_:d130fab692693d6a77e780fe089f251f", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/08612n51r2k", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:ab3f21f5d165afd7557363bab675b138", "@type": "Article"}}]}

Most American economists working on price indexes at the time had ties to the U.S. consumer movement, which emphasized consumer ignorance and promoted expert analysis as the only reliable guide to product quality. During the postwar era, these ties began to dissolve, and as younger economists more readily accepted the market as an arbiter of quality, they likewise saw the econometric analysis of prices and product characteristics as a logical and unproblematic tool for handling quality change in price indexes.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:07Z"}, {"@id": "_:7c3a6f57b81f00a0fc4e4f5a8defee78", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/12579s1800d", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:1233a99ae8957db0ebc62485236f9d5c", "@type": "Article"}}]}

This application allows offline data collection and access while insuring that the data framework aligns with that used by all stakeholders.

The inventory allows the community to access recently-acquired digital data to assist in planning decisions and help develop an increased sense of community ownership.  For community partners without easy access to expensive GIS software, we also ensure that all data are available in an online framework.

Many of these applications seek  phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, n, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of n. For these, the equilibria can be located by solving a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. Typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions, corresponding to equilibria of the model, are of physical interest. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to locate all equilibria of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system.  We compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:19Z"}, {"@id": "_:cd1e127e31b0b18017e131745166a938", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/ww72b853w8x", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:a0f3a8f4301c38b2a9b6d8323293b5fb", "@type": "DataSet"}}]}

Are you still storing 17 drafts of that paper you completed, turned in, edited, resubmitted and received a final grade on years ago because you don’t remember which paper-final-final-final.doc is the actual final copy?   If yes is the answer to any of these questions and those small glimpses resonate, then this workshop is for you. Some small changes will have a big impact on your life. You may know some of these tips already but fail to apply them. Learn how you can begin to form habits of the best practices for file and data file management. Bring your laptop and use time during the session to think about your own best practices and needs and begin to apply the skills. Bring your calendar and set a regular and recurring time to practice the habit of “e-clutter” cleanup.   Participants will: * Recognize the need for and apply regular file maintenance and organization techniques; * Determine which points of practice they need to apply now (and later); * Apply consistent metadata in the use of tags and file naming conventions to assist file management practice; * Identify file or folder structures that support their research areas and needs; * Identify generally what types of data may be stored in which Notre Dame environments;", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:24Z"}, {"@id": "_:079e768574b2d930a1ab2bbe9956635a", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/pz50gt57h4p", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:688a9e8ef2e2355b247f31bf7cddd70d", "@type": "Presentation"}}]}

Christians honor the biological tie between parents and children, for it is the work of God in creation. Yet Christians cannot forget that it is adoption, and not simply natural descent, that is at the center of the New Testament's depiction of God's grace. Gilbert Meilaender takes up a range of issues raised by the practice of adoption, always seeking to do justice to both nature and history in the formation of families, while keeping at the center of our vision the truth that it is not by nature but by grace that we can become adopted children of the one whom Jesus called his Father. Meilaender begins with reflection on the puzzling relation of nature and history in forming families and proceeds to unpack the meaning of _huiothesia_, the word used in the New Testament to name the grace by which a follower of Jesus becomes an adopted child of God. That perspective is applied to a range of questions that regularly arise in Christian theological discussions of adoption: Is adoption only for the infertile? Should single persons adopt? Is it wise for adoption to take place across racial or national boundaries? Special attention is paid to the relation between adoption and new reproductive technologies and to what is called \"embryo adoption.\" Interspersed between the chapters are letters written by the author to his own son by adoption. But if the argument of the book is taken seriously, these letters are written not to one who falls within a special category of \"adopted son or daughter,\" but to one who is, simply and entirely, a son or daughter.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

In the _Summa_ Aquinas works to save and purify the thought of the Greeks and the Arabs in the higher light of Christian Revelation, confident that all that had been rational in the ancient philosophers and their followers would become more rational within Christianity.  This exposition and defense of divine truth has two main parts: the consideration of that truth that faith professes and reason investigates, and the consideration of the truth that faith professes and reason is not competent to investigate. The exposition of truths accessible to natural reason occupies Aquinas in the first three books of the _Summa_. His method is to bring forward demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which are drawn from the philosophers, to convince the skeptic. In the fourth book of the _Summa_ St. Thomas appeals to the authority of the Sacred Scripture for those divine truths that surpass the capacity of reason.  The present volume studies God's existence, nature, and substance, and especially his perfect actuality, the autonomy of his knowledge, the independence of his will, the perfection of his life, and the generosity of his love. Book 2 of the _Summa_ deals with Creation; Book 3, Providence; and Book 4, Salvation.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Eschewing these postmodern approaches, W. Norris Clarke finds an integrated vision of reality in the wisdom of Aquinas and here offers a contemporary version of systematic metaphysics in the Thomistic tradition. The One and the Many presents metaphysics as an integrated whole which draws on Aquinas' themes, structure, and insight without attempting to summarize his work. Although its primary inspiration is the philosophy of St. Thomas himself, it also takes into account significant contributions not only of later philosophers but also of those developments in modern science that have philosophical bearing, from the Big Bang to evolution.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

For Aers, Langland opens up serious diachronic issues concerning Christianity and culture.

Using historical, documentary, and ethnographic data collected over more than a decade as an aid worker and as a researcher in central Ecuador, Jill DeTemple examines the forces that have led to this entanglement of religion and development and the ways in which rural Ecuadorians, as well as development and religious personnel, negotiate these complicated relationships. Technical innovations have been connected to religious change since the time of the Inca conquest, and Ecuadorians have created defensive strategies for managing such connections. Although most analyses of development either tend to ignore the genuinely religious roots of development or conflate development with religion itself, these strategies are part of a larger negotiation of progress and its meaning in twenty-first-century Ecuador. DeTemple focuses on three development agencies-a liberationist Catholic women's group, a municipal unit dedicated to agriculture, and evangelical Protestant missionaries engaged in education and medical work-to demonstrate that in some instances Ecuadorians encourage a hybridity of religion and development, while in other cases they break up such hybridities into their component parts, often to the consternation of those with whom religious and development discourse originate. This management of hybrids reveals Ecuadorians as agents who produce and reform modernities in ways often unrecognized by development scholars, aid workers, or missionaries, and also reveals that an appreciation of religious belief is essential to a full understanding of diverse aspects of daily life.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

The book explores the proliferation of Marian imagery in Late Antiquity through the Church fathers and popular hagiography. It examines how Merovingian authors assimilated powerful queens and abbesses to a Marian prototype to articulate their political significance and, at the same time, censure holy women's public charisma. Mary Thurlkill focuses as well on the importance of Fatima in the evolution of Shi'ite identity throughout the Middle East. She examines how scholars such as Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi advertised Fatima as a symbol of the Shi'ite holy family and its glorified status in paradise, while simultaneously binding her as a mother to the domestic sphere and patriarchal authority.  This important comparative look at feminine ideals in both Shi'ite Islam and medieval Christianity is of relevance and value in the modern world, and it will be welcomed by scholars and students of Islam, comparative religion, medieval Christianity, and gender studies.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Frank's aim is to form a coherent vision, one that may provide some communion about realities of the writer's vocation that have struck her as rarely revealed. Frank offers what she has learned as a writer not only to other writers, but to those to whom good writing matters. Her insights about \"thinking on paper\" are never dogmatic or pontifical; rather, they are cordial and intellectually welcoming. Original, witty, and practical, Frank ably steers us through the journey of her own life as a writer, as well as through the careers and work of other writers. Her subjects range widely, from the \"boot camp\" conditioning of marketing work to squaring off with rejection and envy; from sustaining belief in art's necessity to the baffling subjectivity of literary perception and the magical books that nourish writers. Frank's personal journey is wonderfully told, so that what in these essays is particular becomes useful and universal.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Jonathan Chaplin introduces Dooyeweerd for the first time to many English readers by critically expounding Dooyeweerd's social and political thought and by exhibiting its pertinence to contemporary civil society debates. Chaplin begins by contextualizing Dooyeweerd's thought, first in relation to present-day debates and then in relation to the work of the Dutch philosopher Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920). Chaplin outlines the distinctive theory of historical and cultural development that serves as an essential backdrop to Dooyeweerd's substantive social philosophy; examines Dooyeweerd's notion of societal structural principles; and sets forth his complex classification of particular types of social structure and their various interrelationships. Chaplin provides a detailed examination of Dooyeweerd's theory of the state, its definitive nature, and its proper role vis-à-vis other elements of society. Dooyeweerd's contributions, Chaplin concludes, assist us in mapping the ways in which state and civil society should be related to achieve justice and the public good.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Through a careful historical analysis, Joseph P. Wawrykow delineates the precise function of merit in Aquinas's account of salvation. Wawrykow accounts for the changes in Thomas's teaching on merit from the early Scriptum on the Sentences of Peter Lombard to the later Summa theologiae in two ways. First, he demonstrates how the teaching of the Summa theologiae discloses the impact of Thomas's profound encounter with the later writings of Augustine on predestination and grace. Second, Wawrykow notes the implications of Thomas's mature theological judgment that merit is best understood in the context of the plan of divine wisdom. The portrayal of merit in sapiential terms in the Summa  permits Thomas to insist that the attainment of salvation through merit testifies not only to the dignity of the human person but even more to the goodness of God.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

The \"fourth wave\" of immigration to America is primarily Latino, and the last decades of the twentieth century saw a significant increase in the number of Latino migrants, a diversification of the nations contributing to this migration, and an increase in the size of the native-born Latino population. A backlash against unauthorized immigration, which may indict all Latinos, is also underway. Understanding the growing Latino population, especially its immigrant dimensions, is therefore a key task for researchers in the social sciences and humanities.   The contributors to _Immigration and the Border_ address immigration and border politics and policies, focusing on the U.S. side of the border. The volume editors have arranged the essays into five sections. The two chapters in the first section set the stage and discuss the binational lives of Mexican migrants; chapters in the subsequent sections highlight specific political and policy themes: civic engagement, public policies, political reactions against immigrants, and immigrant leadership. Because the immigration experience encompasses many facets of political life and public policy, the varied perspectives of the contributors offer a mosaic that contextualizes the impact of and contributions by contemporary Latino immigrants. Their research will appeal not only to scholars but to policymakers and the public and will inform contentious debates about migration and migrants.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

This book fills that gap. It offers careful analyses and summaries of Metz's work at the various stages of his career, beginning with his work on Heidegger and his collaboration with Karl Rahner.  It continues with his work in the nineteen-sixties when he moved off in a radically different direction to found a \"new political theology\" culminating in his seminal work, _Faith in History and Society_. Metz addresses themes ranging from the situation of the Church \"after Auschwitz,\" the future of religious life in the Church, and the relationship between religion and politics after the end of the cold war.  J. Matthew Ashley covers all of Metz's writings along with his crucial relationships to figure like Karl Rahner, Martin Heidegger, Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin and the social critics of the early Frankfurt School. Interruptions shows that despite the dramatic turn in the nineteen-sixties there is an underlying continuity in Metz's thought. Ultimately, however, the underlying continuity in Metz's career is defined by a spirituality, a spirituality that is painfully yet hopefully open to the terrible suffering that characterizes our century, a spirituality founded in the Prophets, in Lamentations, and in the figures of Job and the Jesus of Mark's Gospel.  This book shows how Metz has tried to find theological concepts adequate for expressing this spirituality--which he calls a \"Mysticism of open Eyes\" or of \"suffering unto God\"--and to work out its political implications. To this end the book has an opening chapter on the relationship between spirituality and theology, and a closing chapter that shows that the most fundamental difference between Rahner and Metz is rooted in the different Christian spiritual traditions out of which the two operate. Interruptions is essential reading for anyone interest in Spirituality and Mysticism and in their relation to political philosophy.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

More than a Catholic paternalist, Harmel created a model 'earthly paradise' for his workers, drawing on principles of utopian socialism to give labor control over the factory environment. Harmel's effort to lay the groundwork for class conciliation drew praise even from leading Socialists, and his legacy continues in the contemporary world. Coffey's extraordinary synthesis of scholarly works on social, gender, and labor history is as impressive as her original archival research, making this book an important resource for any historian of France or of social issues.

As Thomas P. Scheck demonstrates, however, the _Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans_ by Origen of Alexandria (185-254 CE) was a major work of Pauline exegesis which, by means of the Latin translation preserved in the West, had a significant influence on the Christian exegetical tradition. Scheck begins by exploring Origen's views on justification and on the intimate connection of faith and post-baptismal good works as essential to justification. He traces the enormous influence Origen's Commentary on Romans had on later theologians in the Latin West, including the ways in which theologians often appropriated Origen's exegesis in their own work. Scheck analyzes in particular the reception of Origen by Pelagius, Augustine, William of St. Thierry, Erasmus, Cornelius Jansen, the Anglican Bishop Richard Montagu, and the Catholic lay apologist John Heigham, as well as Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon, and other Protestant Reformers who harshly attacked Origen's interpretation as fatally flawed. But as Scheck shows, theologians through the post-Reformation controversies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries studied and engaged Origen extensively, even if not always in agreement. An important work in patristics, biblical interpretation, and historical theology, _Origen and the History of Justification_ establishes the formative role played by Origen's Pauline exegesis, while also contributing to our understanding of the theological issues surrounding justification in the western Christian tradition.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

By codifying (and imposing) a single written standard, based on a variety of Quechua spoken in the former Inca capital of Cuzco, and through their translations of devotional, catechetical, and liturgical texts for everyday use in parishes, the missionary translators were on the front lines of Spanish colonialism in the Andes. The Christian pastoral texts in Quechua are important witnesses to colonial interactions and power relations. Durston examines the broad historical contexts of Christian writing in Quechua; the role that Andean religious images and motifs were given by the Spanish translators in creating a syncretic Christian-Andean iconography of God, Christ, and Mary; the colonial linguistic ideologies and policies in play; and the mechanisms of control of the subjugated population that can be found in the performance practices of Christian liturgy, the organization of the texts, and even in certain aspects of grammar.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Those who expect historical narratives, stories, or essays on morals are perplexed once they pass the beautiful first Surah, often shocked and then bogged down by Surah 2, and even offended by Surah 3's strictures against nonbelievers. Walter H. Wagner \"opens\" the _Qur'an_ by offering a comprehensive and extraordinarily readable, step-by-step introduction to the text, making it accessible to students, teachers, clergy, and general readers interested in Islam and Islam's holy Book.   Wagner first places the prophet Muhammad, the Qur'an, and the early Muslim community in their historical, geographical, and theological contexts. This background is a basis for interpreting the _Qur'an_ and understanding its role in later Muslim developments as well as for relationships between Muslims, Jews, and Christians. He then looks in detail at specific passages, moving from cherished devotional texts to increasingly difficult and provocative subjects. The selected bibliography serves as a resource for further reading and study. Woven into the discussion are references to Islamic beliefs and practices. Wagner shows great sensitivity toward the risks and opportunities for non-Muslims who attempt to interpret the _Qur'an_, and sympathy in the long struggle to build bridges of mutual trust and honest appreciation between Muslims and non-Muslims.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

A specialist in political theory, Walsh breaks new ground in this volume, arguing, as he says in the introduction, \"that the person is transcendence, not only as an aspiration, but as his or her very reality. Nothing is higher. That is what _Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being_ strives to acknowledge.\" The analysis of the person is the foundation for thinking about political community and human dignity and rights.  Walsh establishes his notion of the person in the first four chapters. He begins with the question as to whether science can in any sense talk about persons. He then examines the person's core activities, free choice and knowledge, and reassesses the claims of the natural sciences. He considers the ground of the person and of interpersonal relationships, including our relationship with God. The final three chapters explore the unfolding of the person, imaginatively in art, in the personal \"time\" of history, and in the \"space\" of politics.  _Politics of the Person as the Politics of Being_ is a new way of philosophizing that is neither subjective nor objective but derived from the persons who can consider such perspectives. The book will interest students and scholars in contemporary political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and any groups interested in the person, personalism, and metaphysics.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Based largely on archival research, the first three chapters trace the legal, social, and economic forces that fueled an upsurge in sex scandal over the course of the Irish Home Rule debates during James Joyce's childhood. The remaining chapters examine Joyce's use of scandal in his work throughout his career, beginning with his earliest known poem, \"Et Tu, Healy,\" written when he was nine years old to express outrage over the politically disastrous Parnell scandal.  Backus's readings of Joyce's essays in a Trieste newspaper, the Dubliners short stories, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses show Joyce's increasingly intricate employment of scandal conventions, ingeniously twisted so as to disable scandal's reifying effects. Scandal Work pursues a sequence of politically motivated sex scandals, which it derives from Joyce's work. It situates Joyce within an alternative history of the New Journalism's emergence in response to the Irish Land Wars and the Home Rule debates, from the Phoenix Park murders and the first Dublin Castle scandal to \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\" and the Oscar Wilde scandal. Her voluminous scholarship encompasses historical materials on Victorian and early twentieth-century sex scandals, Irish politics, and newspaper evolution as well as providing significant new readings of Joyce's texts.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

The Seattle Post-Intelligencer said, \"Bill Meissner captures baseball with all its crystalline beauty-the remarkable reverberation of time and space and character.\" And The New York Times Book Review said, \"Just about every tale here recalls those precious years when a chance to play in the majors was all a boy could ask from life.\"   Now, in his first novel, Bill Meissner again uses baseball as a window to his characters. In _Spirits in the Grass_, we meet Luke Tanner, a thirty-something ball player helping to build a new baseball field in his beloved hometown of Clearwater, Wisconsin. Luke looks forward to trying out for the local amateur team as soon as possible. His chance discovery of a small bone fragment on the field sets in motion a series of events and discoveries that will involve his neighbors, local politicians, and the nearby Native American reservation. Luke's life, most of all, will be transformed. His growing obsession with the ball field and what's beneath it threatens his still fragile relationship with his partner, Louise, and challenges Luke's assumptions about everyone, especially himself.  Spirits in the Grass rings true with small-town Midwestern values. The characters, including Luke's independent partner Louise, grapple with their passion and their identities. In this beautiful and haunting novel, baseball serves as a metaphor for life itself, with its losses and defeats, its glories and triumphs.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Bailey argues that most contemporary policies aimed at reducing poverty in the United States are flawed because they focus solely on insufficient income. Bailey argues that traditional policies such as minimum wage laws, food stamps, housing subsidies, earned income tax credits, and other forms of cash and non-cash income supports need to be complemented by efforts that enable the poor to save and accumulate assets. Drawing on Michael Sherraden's work on asset building and scholarship by Melvin Oliver, Thomas Shapiro, and Dalton Conley on asset discrimination, Bailey presents us with a novel and promising way forward to combat persistent and morally unacceptable poverty in the United States and around the world.  _Rethinking Poverty_ makes use of a significant body of Catholic social teachings in its argument for an asset development strategy to reduce poverty. These Catholic teachings include, among others, principles of human dignity, the social nature of the person, the common good, and the preferential option for the poor. These principles and the related social analyses have not yet been brought to bear on the idea of asset-building for the poor by those working within the Catholic social justice tradition. This book redresses this shortcoming, and further, claims that a Catholic moral argument for asset-building for the poor can be complemented and enriched by Martha Nussbaum's \"capabilities approach.\" This book will affect current debates and practical ways to reduce poverty, as well as the future direction of Catholic social teaching.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Anselm's proof, known since the time of Kant as the ontological argument for the existence of God, has played an important role in the history of philosophy and has been incorporated in various forms into the systems of Descartes, Leibniz, Hegel, and others.  Included in this edition of St. Anselm's _Proslogion_ are Gaunilo's A Reply on Behalf of the Fool and St. Anselm's The Author's Reply to Gaunilo. All three works are given in the original Latin with English translation on facing pages. Professor Charlesworth provides in his introduction a helpful discussion of the context of the Proslogion in the theological tradition and in Anselm's own thought and writing. His commentary exhibits a careful analysis of Anselm's progression of thought and illuminates his argument by comparing it with the later ontological argument of Descartes. Professor Charlesworth deals critically with various interpretations of the _Proslogion_ by later theologians, notably Aquinas and Karl Barth.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Augustine was very interested in this work and included an extraordinary summation of it in his De doctrina christiana. Although this treatment insured the preservation of the work and its lasting fame, Augustine's summary became better known than the original.   Pamela Bright's _The Book of Rules of Tyconius: Its Purpose and Inner Logic_ reintroduces this neglected classic of early church literature. Bright asserts that although Augustine was greatly influenced by the _Liber Regularum_, his philosophical differences caused him to misunderstand its meaning. Bright reexamines the meaning of \"prophecy\" and \"rule\" from Tyconius's perspective and reveals that the purpose of the book was not to provide a general guide to scriptural interpretation, but rather a way to interpret apocalyptic texts. She cites Tyconius's intense concern with evil in the church as the genesis of his interest in the apocalypse and subsequently the meaning of the scripture concerning it. Tyconius speaks of the \"seven mystical rules\" of scripture that with the grace of the Holy Spirit reveal the true meaning of prophecy. If an interpreter follows the \"logic\" of these rules, the nature of the church as composed by both good and evil membership is revealed.  Bright argues that Tyconius was not illogical or incompetent in the work's composition as many critics have claimed but rather that he organized his material in a concentric pattern so that Rule Four, the center of the seven rules, is also the central development of his theory. Of interest to theologians, students of biblical interpretation and of Augustine, _The Book of Rules of Tyconius_ focuses attention upon a work that had great influence on the understanding of the nature of the church, on interpreting scripture, and its meaning for the Church of its day.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Bishop, a philosopher, ethicist, and physician, argues that something has gone sadly amiss in the care of the dying by contemporary medicine and in our social and political views of death, as shaped by our scientific successes and ongoing debates about euthanasia and the \"right to die\"-or to live. _The Anticipatory Corpse: Medicine, Power, and the Care of the Dying_, informed by Foucault's genealogy of medicine and power as well as by a thorough grasp of current medical practices and medical ethics, argues that a view of people as machines in motion-people as, in effect, temporarily animated corpses with interchangeable parts-has become epistemologically normative for medicine. The dead body is subtly anticipated in our practices of exercising control over the suffering person, whether through technological mastery in the intensive care unit or through the impersonal, quasi-scientific assessments of psychological and spiritual \"medicine.\"  The result is a kind of nihilistic attitude toward the dying, and troubling contradictions and absurdities in our practices. Wide-ranging in its examples, from organ donation rules in the United States, to ICU medicine, to \"spiritual surveys,\" to presidential bioethics commissions attempting to define death, and to high-profile cases such as Terri Schiavo's, _The Anticipatory Corpse_ explores the historical, political, and philosophical underpinnings of our care of the dying and, finally, the possibilities of change.  This book is a ground-breaking work in bioethics. It will provoke thought and argument for all those engaged in medicine, philosophy, theology, and health policy.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

In _The Mystical as Political: Democracy and Non-Radical Orthodoxy_, Aristotle Papanikolaou argues that a political theology grounded in the principle of divine-human communion must be one that unequivocally endorses a political community that is democratic in a way that structures itself around the modern liberal principles of freedom of religion, the protection of human rights, and church-state separation.  Papanikolaou hopes to forge a non-radical Orthodox political theology that extends beyond a reflexive opposition to the West and a nostalgic return to a Byzantine-like unified political-religious culture. His exploration is prompted by two trends: the fall of communism in traditionally Orthodox countries has revealed an unpreparedness on the part of Orthodox Christianity to address the question of political theology in a way that is consistent with its core axiom of theosis; and recent Christian political theology, some of it evoking the notion of \"deification,\" has been critical of liberal democracy, implying a mutual incompatibility between a Christian worldview and that of modern liberal democracy.  The first comprehensive treatment from an Orthodox theological perspective of the issue of the compatibility between Orthodoxy and liberal democracy, Papanikolaou's is an affirmation that Orthodox support for liberal forms of democracy is justified within the framework of Orthodox understandings of God and the human person. His overtly theological approach shows that the basic principles of liberal democracy are not tied exclusively to the language and categories of Enlightenment philosophy and, so, are not inherently secular.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

After an introduction and discussion of basic principles, Joseph A. Dane devotes a chapter to quantitative verse (Latin), syllabic or isosyllabic verse (French), and accentual verse (Old English/Germanic). In addition to basic versification systems, the book includes a chapter on musical forms, since verse was originally sung. Most serious studies of these systems in English have been designed for language students, and are not accessible to students of English literature or general readers. This book will enable the reader to scan verse in all three systems, and it will also provide a framework within which students can understand points of contention about particular verse forms.

Arguably, this has been one of the most important yet controversial theological themes of the twentieth century. As globalization creates greater gaps between the rich and the poor, and as the situation for many of the world's poor worsens, there is an ever greater need to understand the gift and challenge of Christian faith from the context of the poor and marginalized of our society. This volume draws on the thought of leading international scholars and explores how the Christian tradition can help us understand the theological foundations for the option for the poor. The central focus of the book revolves around the question, How can one live a Christian life in a world of destitution? The contributors are concerned not only with a social, economic, or political understanding of poverty but above all with the option for the poor as a theological concept. While these essays are rooted in a solid grounding of our present \"reality,\" they look to the past to understand some of the central truths of Christian faith and to the future as a source of Christian hope.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

First, it involves the notion of the divine eternity as the supratemporal source of creaturely time. Second, it involves the eternity of the eschatological New Creation beginning with the bodily Resurrection of Jesus in relation to creaturely time. The key to Russell's engagement with these issues, and the purpose of this book, is to explore Wolfhart Pannenberg's treatment of time and eternity in relation to mathematics, physics, and cosmology.  Time in Eternity is the first book-length exposition of Russell's unique method for relating Christian theology and the natural sciences, which he calls \"creative mutual interaction\" (CMI). This method first calls for a reformulation of theology in light of science and then for the delineation of possible topics for research in science drawing on this reformulated theology. Accordingly, Russell first reformulates Pannenberg's discussion of the divine attributes-eternity and omnipresence-in light of the way time and space are treated in mathematics, physics, and cosmology. This leads him to construct a correlation of eternity and omnipresence in light of the spacetime framework of Einstein's special relativity. In the process he proposes a new flowing time interpretation of relativity to counter the usual block universe interpretation supported by most physicists and philosophers of science. Russell also replaces Pannenberg's use of Hegel's concept of infinity in relation to the divine attributes with the concept of infinity drawn from the mathematics of Georg Cantor. Russell then addresses the enormous challenge raised by Big Bang cosmology to Christian eschatology. In response, he draws on Pannenberg's interpretation both of the Resurrection as a proleptic manifestation of the eschatological New Creation within history and the present as the arrival of the future. Russell shows how such a reformulated understanding of theology can shed light on possible directions for fundamental research in physics and cosmology. These lead him to explore preconditions in contemporary physics research for the possibility of duration, copresence, retroactive causality, and prolepsis in nature  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Demonstrating remarkable erudition and sweeping breadth, _The Quest of the Absolute_ analyzes Romanticism as a unique cultural phenomenon and a spiritual revolution. Dupr\\u00E philosophically reflects on its attempts to recapture the past and transform the present in a movement that is partly a return to premodern culture and partly a violent protest against it. Following an introduction on the historical origins of the Romantic Movement, Dupr\\u00E examines the principal Romantic poets of England (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats), Germany (Goethe, Schiller, Novalis, Hölderlin), and France (Lamartine, de Vigny, Hugo), all of whom, from different perspectives, pursued an absolute ideal. In the chapters of the second part, he concentrates on the critical principles of Romantic aesthetics, the Romantic image of the person as reflected in the novel, and Romantic ethical and political theories. In the chapters of the third, more speculative, part, he investigates the comprehensive syntheses of romantic thought in history, philosophy, and theology.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

But, as Katherine C. Little demonstrates in _Transforming Work: Early Modern Pastoral and Medieval Poetry_, the pastoral mode is in fact indebted to medieval representations of rural labor.   Little offers a new literary history for the pastoral, arguing that the authors of the first English pastorals used rural laborers familiar from medieval texts-plowmen and shepherds-to reflect on the social, economic, and religious disruptions of the sixteenth century. In medieval writing, these figures were particularly associated with the reform of the individual and the social world: their work also stood for the penance and good works required of Christians, the care of the flock required of priests, and the obligations of all people to work within their social class. By the sixteenth century, this reformism had taken on a dangerous set of associations-with radical Protestantism, peasants' revolts, and complaints about agrarian capitalism. Pastoral poetry rewrites and empties out this radical potential, making the countryside safe to write about again.   Moving from William Langland's Piers Plowman and the medieval shepherd plays, through the Piers Plowman-tradition, to Edmund Spenser's pastorals, Little's reconstructed literary genealogy discovers the \"other\" past of pastoral in the medieval and Reformation traditions of \"writing rural labor.\"  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

In _René Girard, Unlikely Apologist: Mimetic Theory and Fundamental Theology_, Grant Kaplan brings mimetic theory into conversation with theology both to elucidate the relevance of mimetic theory for the discipline of fundamental theology and to understand the work of René Girard within a theological framework. Rather than focus on Christology or atonement theory as the locus of interaction between Girard and theology, Kaplan centers his discussion on the apologetic quality of mimetic theory and the impact of mimetic theory on fundamental theology, the subdiscipline that grew to replace apologetics. His book explores the relation between Girard and fundamental theology in several keys. In one, it understands mimetic theory as a heuristic device that allows theological narratives and positions to become more intelligible and, by so doing, makes theology more persuasive. In another key, Kaplan shows how mimetic theory, when placed in dialogue with particular theologians, can advance theological discussion in areas where mimetic theory has seldom been invoked. On this level the book performs a dialogue with theology that both revisits earlier theological efforts and also demonstrates how mimetic theory brings valuable dimensions to questions of fundamental theology.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Newsweek called it a stunning new study of ethics by one of the foremost moral philosophers in the English-speaking world.\" Since that time, the book has been translated into more than fifteen foreign languages and has sold over one hundred thousand copies. Now, twenty-five years later, the University of Notre Dame Press is pleased to release the third edition of _After Virtue_, which includes a new prologue \"_After Virtue_ after a Quarter of a Century.\"  In this classic work, Alasdair MacIntyre examines the historical and conceptual roots of the idea of virtue, diagnoses the reasons for its absence in personal and public life, and offers a tentative proposal for its recovery. While the individual chapters are wide-ranging, once pieced together they comprise a penetrating and focused argument about the price of modernity. In the Third Edition prologue, MacIntyre revisits the central theses of the book and concludes that although he has learned a great deal and has supplemented and refined his theses and arguments in other works, he has \"as yet found no reason for abandoning the major contentions of this book. While he recognizes that his conception of human beings as virtuous or vicious needed not only a metaphysical but also a biological grounding, ultimately he remains \"committed to the thesis that it is only from the standpoint of a very different tradition, one whose beliefs and presuppositions were articulated in their classical form by Aristotle, that we can understand both the genesis and the predicament of moral modernity.\"  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

This book offers a way for social scientists and political theorists to reintegrate the empirical and the normative, proposing a way out of the scientism that clouds our age. In _Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, and the Demise of Naturalism_, Jason Blakely argues that the resources for overcoming this divide are found in the respective intellectual developments of Charles Taylor and Alasdair MacIntyre. Blakely examines their often parallel intellectual journeys, which led them to critically engage the British New Left, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, continental hermeneutics, and modern social science. Although MacIntyre and Taylor are not _sui generis_, Blakely claims they each present a new, revived humanism, one that insists on the creative agency of the human person against reductive, instrumental, technocratic, and scientistic ways of thinking. The recovery of certain key themes in these philosophers' works generates a new political philosophy with which to face certain unprecedented problems of our age. Taylor's and MacIntyre's philosophies give social scientists working in all disciplines (from economics and sociology to political science and psychology) an alternative theoretical framework for conducting research.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Starting with a taxonomy of Thomas Aquinas, according to whom there are nine ways for one to become complicit in the wrongdoing of another, Mellema analyzes each kind of complicity and examines the moral status of someone complicit in each of these ways. Mellema's central argument is that one must perform a contributing action to qualify as an accomplice, and that it is always morally blameworthy to perform such an action. Additionally, he argues that an accomplice frequently bears moral responsibility for the outcome of the other's wrongdoing, but he distinguishes this case from cases in which the accomplice is tainted by the wrongdoing of the principal actor. He further distinguishes between enabling, facilitating, and condoning harm, and introduces the concept of indirect complicity. Mellema tackles issues that are clearly important to any case of collective and shared responsibility, yet rarely discussed in depth, always presenting his arguments clearly, concisely, and engagingly. His account of the nonmoral as well as moral qualities of complicity in wrongdoing-especially of the many and varied ways in which principles and accomplices can interact-is highly illuminating. Liberally sprinkled with helpful and nuanced examples, Complicity and Moral Accountability vividly illustrates the many ways in which one may be complicit in wrongdoing.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Malloy's three-volume memoir examines his eighteen years as president of the University of Notre Dame from 1987 to 2005. In this candid and lively account, Malloy, or \"Monk\" to all who know him, shares his reflections on his presidency following the long-term leadership of Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. Malloy describes his transition into the presidency, his approach to leadership, issues related to Catholic identity, the importance of fund-raising, and finding the proper balance in intercollegiate athletics. Communication issues were of paramount importance during Malloy's tenure, and he discusses how he fostered good relationships with the surrounding community, and supported trustees, administration, faculty, and other important constituencies in the governance of the university. An inveterate multitasker, he also examines how he organized his office and schedule, worked with administrative associates, handled a busy domestic and international travel schedule, sustained his participation in numerous external boards, and kept in regular contact with alumni and friends of the university. Finally, he looks at controversial issues, providing an insider's account of various challenges and crises, from personnel problems to NCAA sanctions to concerns about presidential succession. During nearly two decades, Father Malloy met with presidents and movie stars, sports legends, benefactors, and university employees, many of whom are mentioned in this book. Throughout this volume, Malloy's love for Notre Dame and its students, faculty, and staff comes through clearly, along with his overwhelming sense of gratitude for the opportunity to lead a university where faith, community, and service are taken seriously and passed on from one generation to the next.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Hesburgh, C.S.C., who served as the president of the University of Notre Dame from 1952 until 1987. Beginning as an undergraduate student during the 1960s, when he covered Hesburgh and Notre Dame for the Associated Press, to 2014 when he conducted his last visit with the frail ninety-seven-year-old priest, Schmuhl maintained a unique relationship with Father Hesburgh. Over time, Hesburgh's meetings with Schmuhl evolved into a friendship, which is documented in this personal and warmhearted portrait of the man who was for decades considered the most influential priest in America. Fifty Years with Father Hesburgh: On and Off the Record contains excerpts and commentary from various interviews Schmuhl conducted with Father Hesburgh about his service as Notre Dame's president, including the most difficult years of his presidency during the 1960s, when Notre Dame and other college campuses were in turmoil because of student protests against the Vietnam War and other issues. Knowing and working with four popes and nine U.S. presidents, Father Hesburgh was a moral force in virtually all major social issues of his day, including civil rights, peaceful uses of atomic energy, third-world development, and immigration reform. Schmuhl records Hesburgh's candid reflections on the U.S. presidents with whom he worked and his assessment of the years after he left the university's presidency and maintained an active life of service in retirement. Schmuhl expresses his devotion and respect in the chapters about Hesburgh's twilight decades. He describes how Hesburgh dealt with macular degeneration and blindness in his later years, enlisting students to read the New York Times and other publications to him. During the 1990s and the first years of the twenty-first century, Father Ted was, as he liked to say, \"everybody's grandfather.\" His open-door policy extended beyond students to faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors, and continued right up until the end of his life. Throughout the book, Schmuhl captures the essence, spirit, and humanity of a great leader.  © University of Notre Dame\\  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

A former dean of the College of Arts and Letters at the University of Notre Dame, Roche argues for the importance of an institutional vision, not simply a brand, and while he extols the value of entrepreneurship, he defines it in contrast to the corporate drive toward commercialization and demands for business management models. Using the history of the German university to assess the need for, and implementation of, distinctive visions at American colleges and universities, Roche's own vision benefits from his deep connection to both systems as well as his experience in the trenches working to realize the special mission of an American Catholic university. Roche makes a significant contribution by delineating means for moving such an institution from vision to implementation.   Roche provides a road map to creating a superb arts and sciences college within a major research university and offers a rich analysis of five principles that have shaped the modern American university: flexibility, competition, incentives, accountability, and community. He notes the challenges and problems that surface with these categories and includes ample illustration of both best practices and personal missteps. The book makes clear that even a compelling intellectual vision must always be linked to its embodiment in rhetoric, support structures, and community. Throughout this unique and appealing contribution to the literature on higher education, Roche avoids polemic and remains optimistic about the ways in which a faculty member serving in administration can make a positive difference.  _Realizing the Distinctive University_ is a must read for academic administrators, faculty members interested in the inner workings of the university, and graduate students and scholars of higher education.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Now, in _I Want You to Be_, Halík examines the connection between faith and love, meditating on a statement attributed to St. Augustine-_amo, volo ut sis_, \"I love you: I want you to be\"-and its importance for contemporary Christian practice. Halík suggests that because God is not an object, love for him must be expressed through love of human beings. He calls for Christians to avoid isolating themselves from secular modernity and recommends instead that they embrace an active and loving engagement with nonbelievers through acts of servitude. At the same time, Halík critiques the drive for mere material success and suggests that love must become more than a private virtue in contemporary society. _I Want You to Be_ considers the future of Western society, with its strong division between Christian and secular traditions, and recommends that Christians think of themselves as partners with nonbelievers. Halík's distinctive style is to present profound insights on religious themes in an accessible way to a lay audience. As in previous books, this volume links spiritual and theological/philosophical topics with a tentative diagnosis of our times. This is theology written on one's knees; Halík is as much a spiritual writer as a theologian.

Barr demonstrates that what is really at war with religion is not science itself, but a philosophy called scientific materialism. _Modern Physics and Ancient Faith_ argues that the great discoveries of modern physics are more compatible with the central teachings of Christianity and Judaism about God, the cosmos, and the human soul than with the atheistic viewpoint of scientific materialism.  Scientific materialism grew out of scientific discoveries made from the time of Copernicus up to the beginning of the twentieth century. These discoveries led many thoughtful people to the conclusion that the universe has no cause or purpose, that the human race is an accidental by-product of blind material forces, and that the ultimate reality is matter itself. Barr contends that the revolutionary discoveries of the twentieth century run counter to this line of thought. He uses five of these discoveries-the Big Bang theory, unified field theories, anthropic coincidences, G\\00F6 del's Theorem in mathematics, and quantum theory-to cast serious doubt on the materialist's view of the world and to give greater credence to Judeo-Christian claims about God and the universe.  Written in clear language, Barr's rigorous and fair text explains modern physics to general readers without oversimplification. Using the insights of modern physics, he reveals that modern scientific discoveries and religious faith are deeply consonant. Anyone with an interest in science and religion will find _Modern Physics and Ancient Faith_ invaluable.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

A week later, in a written statement, Hyde announced that he had renounced Communism and, with his wife and children, was joining the Catholic Church.  The long pilgrimage from Communism to Christ carried Douglas Hyde from complete commitment to Marxism, to a questioning uneasiness about Soviet Russia's glaring contradictions of ideology and action, to a final rejection of the Party.  In DEDICATION AND LEADERSHIP, he advances the theory that although the goals and aims of Communism are antithetical to human dignity and the rights of the individual, there is much to be learned from communist methods, cadres and psychological motivation. Hyde describes the Communist mechanics of instilling dedication, the first prerequisite for leadership. Here is the complete rationale of party technique: how to stimulate the willingness to sacrifice; the advisibility of making big demands to insure a big response; the inspirational indoctrination; and the subtle conversion methods.  In this small book, so large with implications, Douglas Hyde comments on both Communist and Catholic potential and their lack of maximum effectiveness. He advocates positive Catholic action, not just a negative anti-Communism, and he points out that the guidelines are now down for a decisive choice between total Communism and a total Christianity.  Here is a realistic approach to an acute problem uncolored by emotional propaganda, and here is a realistic answer on how to inspire dedication for leadership.  © University of Notre Dame  Copyright for most content is held by The University of Notre Dame.

Sr Neal was a member of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur.  She started her teaching career at Emmanuel College in 1953 later receiving a doctorate in sociology from Harvard University in 1963.  In 1965 she became Director of the Research Committee for the Conference of Major Superiors of Women (later renamed The Leadership Conference of Women Religious).  In this position she began a study of the lives and attitudes of women religious in light of the implementation of changes brought on by the decrees of the Vatican II Council.  In 1967 she directed a survey of all members of congregations of women religious.  She prepared a survey of 649 questions which went out to nearly 400 congregations numbering over 130,000 individual sisters, and some demographic information.  The dataset presented here consists of the responses to this survey.  She did follow-up surveys from 1968 to 1990, but none of these later studies involved near this number of respondents and they are not part of this dataset.  The surveys and looked at the values and beliefs of women religious in a formative period for all religious congregations in the wake of Vatican II.  Most of the survey questions elicited answers in the form of Likert scales (e.g. agree, neutral, disagree). Sister Neal published extensively on the results of her work.  The Sister Survey, as her collective research became known, is not without controversy but the results are still of great interest today.    The information compiled by Sr. Neal during her decades of research came to the University of Notre Dame Archives in 1995 and 1996 as part of the Sr. Neal papers.  The original magnetic tapes (21 tapes) that recorded the findings of Sr. Neal’s work were copied to contemporary format tapes (a total of two tapes) in late 1995, then to two cartridges and finally to a CD. The University of Notre Dame Archives fully documented all of the transfers, along with the technical information that allow the current dataset to be extracted from all of the information contained on original tapes donated to the University Archives.  The finding aid of Sr Neal papers can be found at http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/xml/nea.xml.

All other columns contain the sisters’ chosen answers to each of the 649 questions, which are cross-referenced in the codebook.

Ten years later, in 2017, the community came together to evaluate a decade of progress towards achieving these goals. These proceedings document some of that progress. They include a series of short position papers, representing current work in the community organized across four process axes of traceability practice. The sessions covered topics from Trace Strategizing, Trace Link Creation and Evolution, Trace Link Usage, real-world applications of Traceability, and Traceability Datasets and benchmarks.  Two breakout groups focused on the importance of creating and sharing traceability datasets within the research community, and discussed challenges related to the adoption of tracing techniques in industrial practice. Members of the research community are engaged in many active, ongoing, and impactful research projects. Our hope is that ten years from now we will be able to look back at a productive decade of research and claim that we have achieved the overarching Grand Challenge of Traceability, which seeks for traceability to be always present, built into the engineering process, and for it to have \"effectively disappeared without a trace\".  We hope that others will see the potential that traceability has for empowering software and systems engineers to develop higher-quality products at increasing levels of complexity and scale, and that they will join the active community of Software and Systems traceability researchers as we move forward into the next decade of research.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:54Z"}, {"@id": "_:2f7e94fb9df8deb1b9062d91a7d8d0b1", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/bn999596m3v", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:5e7a0fc2eaaf61ac2464f89cbcb75311", "@type": "Publication"}}]}

They do no know where to start, and are unable to select appropriate terms or sources to search. Furthermore, instructors overestimate the literature research skills of their students. In CHEM 23201, a required one semester course, we introduced a research strategy worksheet as a way to guide students on things to consider when searching the literature. We assumed that they would need more help in using the unique features of the discovery tools than in selecting search terms. Our assumptions were wrong. An examination of the tenets of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains and its explanation of higher-order thinking skills, which include asking questions, could have predicted the difficulty the students initially had with the worksheet.

The systems and their interactions thus need to be continuously monitored and checked during operation to determine compliance with requirements. Many requirements monitoring approaches have been proposed. However, only few of these come with tools that present and visualize monitoring results and details on requirements violations to end users such as industrial engineers. In this tool demo paper we present visualization capabilities we have been developing motivated by industrial scenarios. Our tool complements REMINDS, an existing requirements monitoring framework, which supports collecting, aggregating, and analyzing events and event data in architecturally heterogeneous SoS. Our visualizations support a 'drill-down' scenario for monitoring and diagnosis: starting from a graphical status overview of the monitored systems and their relations, engineers can view trends and statistics about performed analyses and diagnose the root cause of problems by inspecting the events and event data that led to a specific violation.

To model the air-sea exchange of heat under high-wind conditions, it is important yet challenging to understand influences of evaporative droplets in the atmospheric boundary layer. We implement a high-resolution Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm with varied droplets laden in a turbulent open-channel flow to reveal the dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of droplets. Our past numerical simulations demonstrated an overall weak modification to the total heat flux by evaporative droplets, due to redistributed sensible and latent heat fluxes from relatively small droplets that respond rapidly to the ambient environment or the limited the residence time of larger droplets. However, droplets with a slower thermodynamic response to the environment indicate a potential to enhance the total heat flux, but it is dependent on concentration and suspension time. In the current study, we investigate more insights of droplets behavior. We focus on correlations between the resident time and thermodynamic statistics of droplets with the herein influence on heat fluxes, in both real and spectral space. In addition, we validate our results on different scales of turbulence, which will be helpful when applying the results into further practical parameterization.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:19:56Z"}, {"@id": "_:feba7836156bc81f228f3fa47f5f79ad", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/dz010p1218g", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:395aafa865e5b63ec1e72067fd4e17d2", "@type": "Presentation"}}]}

Moreover, the methyl group in the methacrylate portion of the ester gives this compound much greater stability than possessed by the corresponding acrylates. This stability is particularly useful when it is desirable to produce reaction on the acetylenic group but not on the ethylenic. Moreover, the terminal acetylenic makes possible certain reactions which cannot be effected with compounds in which the acetylenic group is not a terminal group. Furthermore the presence of the methyl group in the methacrylate portion of the ester gives sufficient greater polymerization tendency, as compared with the acrylate, that the ethylenic group can be polymerized with less stringent conditions and thereby reduces the tendency for reaction of the anionic initiator with the ester group; the molecular weights and conversions are thereby higher.

A surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) flow detector capable of ultrasensitive optical detection on the millisecond time scale has been developed. The device employs hydrodynamic focusing to improve SERS detection in a flow channel where a sheath flow confines analyte molecules eluted from a capillary over a planar SERS-active substrate. Increased analyte interactions with the SERS substrate significantly improve detection sensitivity. Raman experiments at different sheath flow rates showed increased sensitivity compared with the modeling predictions, indicating increased adsorption. At low analyte concentrations, rapid analyte desorption is observed, enabling repeated and high-throughput SERS detection. The flow detector offers substantial advantages over conventional SERS-based assays such as minimal sample volumes and high detection efficiency.", "date_updated": "2018-02-26T18:20:43Z"}, {"@id": "_:c816a6a3250337d3f99fb1c6c1401fe5", "uri": "https://curate.nd.edu/show/5712m61680r", "@type": "WorkIdentifier", "creative_work": {"@id": "_:2a40aa02881f476b893cfc698762d407", "@type": "Patent"}}]}

At present, this is the most comprehensive record of patents issued by Mexican governments during the nineteenth century.  There is no single archival or published source that contains a comprehensive list or data on Mexican patents issued over the course of the long nineteenth century, and thus no other way to access the full breadth of this source for the history of technology. The section (ramo) “Patentes y Marcas” in the Archivo General de la Nación (AGN) contains official files on about one thousand four hundred (1,400) patents, or about one-tenth of the total issued by the federal government. Many of the files held in the AGN represent rich sources of detailed evidence on inventions and patent claims by applicants, including application letters, technical drawings, administrative notes, and sometimes additional materials. But the documents in the AGN represent only a small fraction of the patents issued by Mexican governments over the course of the nineteenth century and thus do not offer a useful guide to broader patterns or trends.
